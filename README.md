Project Overview:
In the construction industry, safety is paramount. I've developed a deep learning model powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect whether construction workers are wearing helmets or not, thus ensuring their safety on the job site.

Data Exploration:
To kickstart this project, I collected a diverse dataset of images featuring construction workers. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) helped me gain valuable insights into the data, from understanding the distribution of helmeted vs. non-helmeted workers to assessing image quality.

Data Preprocessing:
Robust data preprocessing was key to model success. I resized images, implemented data augmentation techniques, and normalized pixel values, ensuring that the CNN could learn effectively from the data.

CNN Model:
I employed a state-of-the-art CNN architecture, designed specifically for image recognition tasks. CNNs are perfect for such tasks due to their ability to capture intricate features in images.

Training and Evaluation:
The model was trained using a carefully split dataset for training and validation. Optimized training parameters, loss functions, and a diligent choice of optimization algorithms contributed to its success. The model's performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
